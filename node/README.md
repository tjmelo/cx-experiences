![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-gray?style=flat&logo=Npm)

The code snippets were created by using node version: `v16+` 

Instructions
=

Download the project and install the necessary dependencies

```console
cx@experiences:~$ npm install
```

### Note
For security questions, all information about port and status code were allocated inside a `.env`. So, it's necessary to create a new file `.env` at the root of application, as bellow:

```console
  APP_PORT="3000" #port example
  STATUS_CODE="200" #status code example
```

Follow through with the sessions bellow:
